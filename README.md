# My Express Starter kit

## skeleton wireframe

this is just my own boilerplate code for an blog like appliction
built on top of Express and Nodejs with mongo as a no-sql solution

## Leaflet
I'm using leaflet, a mobile friendly javascript map solution
leaflet is really nice to look at. I'm happy with first impressions.
